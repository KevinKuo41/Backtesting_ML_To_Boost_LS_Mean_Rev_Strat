#### 21 accounting items, share prices, shares outstanding, and total returns for all companies listed from 1998 to 2022 are downloaded from the S&P Compustat Fundamentals Dataset. Among them, 21 accounting items are most on a quarterly basis, since they were only updated at the end of every quarter. By contrast, share prices and shares outstanding are on a monthly basis.
