#	Feature Importance
#### Modelâ€™s SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations, Lundberg et al. 2017) values or impurity-based importance (Breiman et al., 1984) are computed to help understand which feature variables matter to models in fair equity value estimate. Figures in Appendix 7.6 illustrate the average feature importance for each model over the whole sample period. <br><br>The OLS benchmark, NN2, NN3 and NN5 models primarily rely on only 1 to 3 feature variables. Instead, the RF, XGB, NN4, and NN6 models draw information from 6 to 10 feature variables. Additionally, the LSTM model seems to extract information from all 21 feature variables. The ML models, except for the LSTM, are somehow consistent in selecting feature variables as the source of information. Cash & Short-Term Investments, Common/Ordinary Equity, Non-operating Income, Income Taxes, and Property Plant & Equipment are the 5 feature variables that most ML models use to estimate the fair equity value. <br>
